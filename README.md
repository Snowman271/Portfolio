If i want to edit page to grow or shrink based off of screen size I would use meida screen with multiple max widths for all sizing 
            @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
                img {
                    width: 120px;
                    height: 90px;
                }
            }

            @media screen and (max-width: 368px) {
                img {
                    width: 120px;
                    height: 90px;
                }
            }

            @media screen and (max-width: 268px) {
                img {
                    width: 120px;
                    height: 90px;
                }
            }

            @media screen and (max-width: 168px) {
                img {
                    width: 120px;
